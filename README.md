# Violent_Crimes_Regression_Analysis

## Project Description
This project focuses on using regression analysis to obtain potential predictive factors in identifying
violent crime incidence in communities to examine its short and long-term social impacts in society. Model selection methods were performed in determining the best regression model, where appropriate model diagnostics and transformations were performed.

## Affilation
This independent project was conducted for the Unversity of Notre Dame's Linear Models course taught by Dr. Alan Huebner.
